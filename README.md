## Research
##### AMM
- [Replicating Monotonic Payoffs Without Oracles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13740.pdf)
  > In this paper, we show that any monotonic payoff can be replicated using only
liquidity provider shares in constant function market makers (CFMMs), without the
need for additional collateral or oracles. Such payoffs include cash-or-nothing calls and
capped calls, among many others, and we give an explicit method for finding a trading
function matching these payoffs. For example, this method provides an easy way to
show that the trading function for maintaining a portfolio where 50% of the portfolio
is allocated in one asset and 50% in the other is exactly the constant product market
maker (e.g., Uniswap) from first principles. We additionally provide a simple formula
for the total earnings of an arbitrageur who is arbitraging against these CFMMs.
- [Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) with
Automated Market Maker (AMM) Protocols](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12732.pdf)
  > As an integral part of the decentralized finance
(DeFi) ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEX) with automated
market maker (AMM) protocols have gained massive traction
with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed
ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the
buy and sell sides, AMMs employ a peer-to-pool method and
determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development
of AMM-based DEX, we create the first systematization of
knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM
framework describing the economics and formalizing the system‚Äôs
state-space representation. We then employ our framework to
systematically compare the top AMM protocols‚Äô mechanics,
illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and
divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy
concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEX‚Äôs inherent
properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct
a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both
DeFi and conventional market microstructure.
- [Optimal Fees for Geometric Mean Market
Makers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00446.pdf)
  > Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) are a family
of automated market makers that enable censorship-resistant decentralized exchange on public blockchains. Arbitrage trades have been shown
to align the prices reported by CFMMs with those of external markets.
These trades impose costs on Liquidity Providers (LPs) who supply reserves to CFMMs. Trading fees have been proposed as a mechanism for
compensating LPs for arbitrage losses. However, large fees reduce the
accuracy of the prices reported by CFMMs and can cause reserves to
deviate from desirable asset compositions. CFMM designers are therefore faced with the problem of how to optimally select fees to attract liquidity. We develop a framework for determining the value to LPs of
supplying liquidity to a CFMM with fees when the underlying process
follows a general diffusion. Focusing on a popular class of CFMMs which
we call Geometric Mean Market Makers (G3Ms), our approach also allows one to select optimal fees for maximizing LP value. We illustrate
our methodology by showing that an LP with mean-variance utility will
prefer a G3M over all alternative trading strategies as fees approach zero.
